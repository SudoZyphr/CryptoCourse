Executive Summary
This paper is about to see if we are able predict an increase or decrease in the price of the coin just based off of the tweets about the coin. This will look at the tweets and the price of the coin during the same hour to see if the coin was affected by the potential big accounts and whether those tweets had affected the price. I am mostly interested to see if there is a level of manipulation and influence that certain bigger accounts could have on that market. â€‹I am assuming that the price could be easily manipulated and influenced based on the age of the market. Since this is a relatively new market that is based upon technology then I wanted to find out if the technology of social media could highly affect the price.
